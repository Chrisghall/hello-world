Setup repository

Testing GitHub out...

Currently working on XAMPP application for project requirements management, using JS/jQuery/jQueryUI and PHP.  Looking to migrate to AWS platform for Alpha testing shortly.

First programming/development job was writing a test control system for a white goods testing laboratory in 1990... using BASICA (go look it up in a history book, kids).
